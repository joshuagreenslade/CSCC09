## Building the features

**Grade (TA only)**

- max2: 40
- score2: 37
 
---

1. The application: [select many]
    - x does not use any server side feature
    - x does not use any library
    
1. The **image uploader** as described in the handout: [select one]
    - _ is unimplemented 
    - _ is somehow implemented but does not realized its main functionality overall
    - _ does achieve its main functionality overall but several features are missing
    - _ does work well but couple of features are missing or not working properly
    - x does work very well overall and all features are properly implemented

    In the box below, write down the features that you were not able to implement or make it work properly:  
**Comments**
```
Image uploader checks for errors by not submiting if part of the form (title, author, file) is empty. Comment form checks for errors by not submiting if part of the form (author, message) is empty.
```
    
1. The **image browsing** as described in the handout: [select one]

    - _ does work well but couple of features are missing or not working properly
    - x does work very well overall and all features are properly implemented
    
    In the box below, write down the features that you were not able to implement or make it work properly:  
**Comments**
```
Images have a max size so they do not cover other elements on the page. The size of the image area is the same for all images so the screen does not bounce around when navigating through the different images. The navigation arrows extend to the entire height of the image so you do not have to click directly on the arrow.
```
    
1. The **comments** as described in the handout: [select one]
    - _ is unimplemented 
    - _ is somehow implemented but does not realized its main functionality overall
    - _ does achieve its main functionality overall but several features are missing
    - x does work well but couple of features are missing or not working properly
    - _ does work very well overall and all features are properly implemented
    
    In the box below, write down the features that you were not able to implement properly:  
**Comments**
```
When you delete a comment, it gets deleted and the 10 most recent comments are always shown. Could not get it to stay and display the section of the comments that the comment was deleted from.
```

    - _ is unimplemented 
    - _ is somehow implemented but does not realized its main functionality overall
    - _ does achieve its main functionality overall but several features are missing
    - _ does work well but couple of features are missing or not working properly
    - x does work very well overall and all features are properly implemented
    
    In the box below, write down the features that you were not able to implement properly:  
**Comments**
```
When an id is given in the url that is wrong, the user is sent to a seperate 404 page.
```

1. Overall, when using the application: [select one]
    - _ it does not work because several features are not implemented
    - _ it does not work well as a simple usage does not give the expected results or generates errors
    - _ it works relatively well but a heavy usage does not give the expected results or generates errors
    - x it works really well under all kinds of usages
    - _ it works exceptionally well and tolerates bad usages (security aside): bad user inputs, UI stress and so on

In the box below, write any comment you would like to communicate the TA regarding the work done for this part: 

**Comments**
```
File upload button only allows users to upload images, but url upload does not check to make sure if the given url is an image.
```
